## The current state of things:

Feels like just yesterday the 1.21.6 update came out...

**So, you'd think they would be working on 1.22? Or, at the very least, taking a rest after releasing an update.**

But, no.

Instead, they were working on a bug fix release, and wanted to add references to *A Minecraft Movie*. Seen below are the new Dennis painting and the new music disc which plays a remixed version of Jack Black's "Lava Chicken" song.

With so little content added and so few bug fixes in this release that pertain to certain hardware fixes, I have decided not to update the server to this version immediately when it comes out until I can confirm that it will not break existing plugins on the server.[^1]

#### A bit of trivia though: Did you know that this is the first *Java Edition* 1.x.7 release since 1.8.7, which released more than a decade prior (in June 2015)?

#### But, there were some changes in between now and then so here they are:

## :twemoji-check-mark-button: New Features & Enhancements

- The server has been bumped to the newest Paper build: [57c202e](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper/commit/57c202e01516b653aea9c7e050eaded1448863e5)

## :mdi-paperclip: Removals:

- Removed the **Banknotes** plugin until a more modern solution can be rewritten by me

And that's my two cents on this, I plan on adding new plugins (*maybe*) that will hopefully add new mechanics to the game but, we'll see. People are already getting burned out[^2], but, the goal was to get every achievement, and there are plenty more than still have not been achieved yet.

And that's it! Please stick around for future updates and 1.21.7!

[^1]: No release date for the update has been shared with anyone, and the new changes are already live in a Bedrock preview, so I assume its only a matter of time before they go to Java.
[^2]: Just suggest things in the Discord and I'll look into things
