# There is now an Economy!

Players can check how much money they have by running ```/bal``` in game. You can also sell items to the server, a list of which I will post (keep in mind, that these items were the default values, and I will change things that I see fit).

You can now also see, who the richest player is by running ```/baltop```, this keeps the server competitive and maybe something will happen to whoever is the richest longest? :twemoji-eyes: 

#### A scoreboard has also been added to help players keep track of their money and will be updated in the future.

### Player shops provided by [ChestShops!](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/chestshop.51856/) :twemoji-party-popper:
I will be writing on how you can create shops, in a document that you can refer back to, since the old documentation is hard to follow.

The documentation for that can be found [here](https://ld3z.github.io/site2/chestshops/)

Please stay until 1.21.6!

-Cheers,
Ldez
