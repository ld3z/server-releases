## Just an update:

I have switched VPS providers, hopefully this stops lag, and the server randomly going down.

### Rollbacks are now supported, but *they should have been this entire time* :twemoji-person-facepalming:

**Also**, since the server has been going down lately, as well as griefing has been happening on the server, there is now protection put into place. I would also recommend using a mini-map mod to log your deaths just in case the server goes down and you cannot get your stuff back.
