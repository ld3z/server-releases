It's quiet now.

There was a time when this place was loud. Full of the sounds of breaking blocks, hurried footsteps, and laughter over Discord. We had plans. Grandiose designs for sprawling cities, complex redstone contraptions, and adventures that would span continents.

I poured hours into this world. Not just playing, but *working*. Configuring plugins, troubleshooting errors, performing backups. I was the architect and the janitor of our digital kingdom. I did it gladly, believing we were building something together. A shared space, a testament to our friendship.

But the seasons change. Logins became less frequent. The grand projects stalled, half-finished skeletons baking in the perpetual noon sun. The vibrant community faded into a ghost town. Now, the only sound is the wind whistling through empty halls and the gentle hum of the server fans, spinning for no one.

I walk through the silent streets of our abandoned metropolis and see not the triumphs of our collaboration, but a monument to my own wasted time. Every block placed, every line of configuration written, feels like a minute I can't get back, spent on something that was ultimately ephemeral and, it seems, unimportant to anyone but me.

This world was supposed to be for us. Now, it's just for me. A museum of memories and a stark reminder that some things, no matter how much effort you pour into them, are destined to be abandoned.

So, here it stands. A digital graveyard. A testament to friendships that drifted apart and the folly of investing time in castles made of sand.

of course, a modded server is indev, so maybe people will play that, but probably not...
